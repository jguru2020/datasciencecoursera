## Excecutive Summary

Goal of this project is to create a web application using R & ShinyApp that provides a mechanism to enter a 
word phrase as an input and will also predict the next word based on N-Gram alogorithms.

## Approach

1. Downloaded the dataset(twitter,news and blogs) in consideration
2. Reviewed the details of the dataset(size, lines, word count ect.)
3. Since data size is huge sampled the data
4. Performed clean-up tasks like removing and stemming using **tm** package
5. Created Unigram, Bigram,Trigram and Quadgram tokens using **quanteda** package 
6. Save DFMs to local file (with rds extension)
7. Create ShinyApp with N-gram prediction model

## Outcomes

Test the following web application:

Review the implementation:
